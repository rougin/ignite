ignite.php
======

A simple PHP script that deletes unwanted files and folders then installs [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) (an object-relational mapper for PHP 5.3.3+), and [Combustor](https://github.com/rougin/combustor) (a CRUD generator) for CodeIgniter 3 be ready for writing web applications.

Instructions
============
1. This script requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) in order to get it work. Download and install the latest version of it first. The instructions for that can be found [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/). If you have installed Composer already on your system, then you can skip this step.
2. Clone the latest version of CodeIgniter (in the develop branch) (or you can also download the latest stable release [here](https://ellislab.com/codeigniter/download)) and extract it afterwards.
	```git clone https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter.git```
3. Clone or download this repository.
	```git clone https://github.com/rougin/ignite.php.git```
4. After cloning, copy the **ignite.php** file from the **ignite.php** folder to the **CodeIgniter** directory.
5. Open the cloned **CodeIgniter** directory then run **ignite.php** from PHP CLI.
	```php ignite.php```
